# Separated-Laravel

What? You want only have one Laravel folder and it can be used by multiple 
projects and works fine? This is it. At least for Laravel 5.

## About this repo

This is a **fully-working** repo with **minimal changes** to an official 
`Laravel` application, actually this repo is started with an official `Laravel` 
project, all modifications are in the `Git` log with description, and they're 
really clear.

If you like this please feel free to star this(let `Laravel` people know 
there're people using `Laravel` like this), or if you have some questions, you 
can create a new issue.

## Known issue

`artisan optimize` is not working, because it has some hard-code paths. But I 
using a customized `optimize` to do this, you can do that too.
